                The information provided on the Site is not intended for
                distribution to or use by any person or entity in any
                jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be
                contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any
                registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country.
                Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Site from
                other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely
                responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent

                etc.), so if your interactions would be subjected to such laws,
                you may not use this Site. You may not use the Site in a way
                that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).

                exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use
                shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These
                Terms of Use operate to the fullest extent permissible by law.
                We may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others

                Use will not be construed against us by virtue of having drafted
                them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based
